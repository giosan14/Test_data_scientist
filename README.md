Python:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
*A CSV file containing information about movies on Netflix is provided.
Task: The candidate should clean the data by handling missing values (imputation or elimination based on logical reasoning), removing duplicates, filling missing rows, deleting unnecessary columns, and splitting columns where necessary.

Expected Outcome: A clean CSV file ready for analysis and a Python script used for cleaning.

2. ETL Process Development:
Task: Write a Python script that extracts data from the NBA API, transforms it to match a given schema, and loads it into a SQLite database.

Expected Outcome: A Python script for the ETL process and a SQLite database with integrated data.

3. Data Analysis and Reporting:
Task: Using the following dataset on transactions in an e-commerce platform, conduct exploratory data analysis to find key business metrics:
1. How has the sales trend been over the months?
2. What are the most frequently purchased products?
3. How many products does a customer buy in each transaction?
4. What are the most profitable customer segments?
5. Based on the insights, what strategy would you recommend to the business to make it more profitable?
Generate a PDF report with findings, including graphs and a summary.

Expected Outcome: A Jupyter notebook with analysis and visualizations. Develop a dashboard in Tableau for visualization and prepare an executive presentation for the C-Level team.

Database Management Exercise:
1. Database Schema Design:
Task: Design a suitable database schema for an e-commerce platform handling products, orders, customers, and shipping information. The design should be outlined, including table structures, relationships, and indexes.

Expected Outcome: A database schema diagram with a brief explanation of design choices and security.

2. Business Problem Solution:
Task:
1. Profitability of plans.
a. The telecommunications company "X" wants to know how profitable each of the plans they offer is, i.e., how much profit they make per plan based on cost and income. Explain, in the form of an "algorithm-recipe," the methodology you would use to obtain the average profitability per plan, taking into account the following considerations:
i. There is a database with the following information
1. Table with plan information
a. Validity period per plan
b. Allowed consumption units per plan
i. Data
ii. Voice
iii. SMS
c. Plan cost with VAT
d. Plan renewal period
2. Table with user information
a. User ID
b. Assigned plan
c. Table with consumption information per line
d. Line
e. Date of consumption
f. Type of consumption
3. Table with cost information per consumption unit type
a. Cost per MB without VAT
b. Cost per minute without VAT
c. Cost per SMS without VAT

Expected Outcome: Explanation in the form of an algorithm of the methodology to obtain profitability with optimization suggestions and analysis to develop to find the optimal profitability.
